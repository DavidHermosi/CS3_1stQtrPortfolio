## by David Hermoso, 9 - Lithium

### Points found interesting

* DOE Net Metering Program
* 50% Discount for PWD, Seniors, and Students for MRT & LRT
* "The Philippines is a friend to all, an enemy to none."

### Points found weird

* The implementation is P20 Rice/kg can now be implemented without putting our farmers at risk.
* "Handa na ang Pilipinas. Invest in the Philippines."

### Reflection
<p>This SONA 2025, PBBM showcased lots of achievements. Some of his promises feel unkept despite his confident demeanor. Considering his family background and his rumored lifestyle at some point I would seem to doubt if he really is qualified to be our president. I still respect him as our leader.</p>
<p>As PBBM's presidency has reached the halfway mark, I feel that his full potential as a national leader is hindered as many people feel like there is no felt changes despite his programs and policies. In his SONA speech, it also seems to me that he was avoiding some major issues like the USA tariffs or the VP Sara impeachment case. Overall, his presidency has major points of improvement.</p>

### Message for the Philippines
> Pray for the best for our beloved country.
