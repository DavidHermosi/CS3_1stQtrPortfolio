## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well.

1. Variable Declaration
<p> Variable Declarations count as one of the easiest topics in JS that I learned. Due to its ease, I eventually mastered it quite quickly. Variables are placeholders for values that you will use. </p>

2. JS Operators  
<p> JS Operators which are usually mathematical operators, are very familiar to me and other students. These operators can be used to manipulate or compare variables. There are many different kinds of operators depending on their use. </p>

3. Markdown
<p> One of the most famous markup languages. Was easy for me to master because of its versatility and its simple tags. The tags of Markdown were easy to understand, and I got the gist of using Markdown quickly and its other features. </p>

4. If statement
<p> A conditional statement I first learned in most coding languages. This was one of the easier statements, because this became the introduction for loops. The if statement is executes a block of code when a condition is true, and you can redirect the code with the else statement showing that the statement is versatile in use.  </p>

5. JS Input & Output Statements
<p> JS Input & Output was well practiced because they are an integral part of our coding tasks. JS input and output statements were well taught, and well tested. JS Input and Output Statements are statements that input and/or output values.  </p>

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.

1. Function Declaration
   <p> Defining functions were clear to me on the surface level. When it comes to integrating other variables and calling multiple types of functions, thats where I tend to become lost in terms of understanding. The parameters often are the points where I mess up when creating the reusable blocks of code.  </p>

2. Switch Statement
   <p> Switch statement is an alternative to the if else statements. I would prefer to use this over the if else, but sometimes I end up forgetting how to proerly use the switch statement, leading to coding errors. I need further practice.</p>
3.  For Loops
   <p> Are loops that perform a code a specified amount of times in a sequence. This was confusing to me because there could be multiple sequences inside a for loop and has the potential to integrate other types of loops or statements within the for loop. This huge use of the for loop sometimes leads me to be confused especially when dealing with multiple conditions.  </p>
4. Function Outputs
   <p> The output of functions sometimes confuse me. To return or to not return a value after using a function still remains to be confusing to me even while I practice. There are times I think the function will return a value, but the opposite happens and vice versa. It can also be confusing when I am working with more than one result to return.  </p>
5.  Function Calls
   <p> Statement where a function is called in the code. I have not mastered all methods of calling the function. Sometimes I still get confused in getting calling the functions and I still need more practice in using the different types of calls. </p>

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

<p> I plan to try to be more attentive in class, while also doing my best to practice the codes with our given tasks or with other websites. I also plan to more questions in class in order to clarify concepts that may be unclear to me. </p>

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

<p> Throughout the activities we did in class, all if not most of the exercises were effective in helping me understand the concepts of our course. Included in the effective activities, was the making of our portfolio and giving us bonus tasks, which really helped me get practice in for our coding topics. Another activity, though still informative, were the in-class lectures that not as effective for me considering I was at the back of the room, and I had some trouble paying attention because of my tablemates. Another ineffective learning method for me would be the kahoot quizzes, though fun, I end up forgetting what was in the quiz most of the time. </p>
